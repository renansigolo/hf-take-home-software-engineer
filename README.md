### Problem Statement

Create a menu planning service which allows to manage weekly menu and associated recipies.

#### Context

- A [weekly menu](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/plans/) contains a set of [recipies](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/). Each week different set of recipies are selected. See example [menu for this week](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/plans/).
- A [recipe](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/beef-veggie-ragu-spaghetti-5fa9c324cb8f8c0b3a183d01) contains ingredients, step-by-step instructions, nutirtional information, classification, and other metadata. See examples recipes here [1](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/southeast-asian-chicken-coconut-soup-5fa9c26209c8db59115d3f4f), [2](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/saucy-coconut-chicken-noodles-5f9b3c7198ecf4455b27d94d), [3](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/dukkah-roasted-sweet-potato-5f9b43847aacaa50f037d858).
- A customer can review weekly menu as well as recipe by assigning ratings and/or adding comments.

#### Tasks

1. Create data models using your selected ORM for weekly menu, recipe, ingredients, review, etc. Make sure these data models are appripriately connected using `FK`, `1:M`, `M:M ` relationships.
2. Create REST APIs to create, list, read, update, delete data model objects. Bonus if you can secure API using API tokens (recommended) or JWT tokens. You can use Google Authentication to obtain JWT token.
3. Create unit and E2E tests. For E2E API tests you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) but ensure Postman collection are commited to your repository. For unit tests use a framework acccording to your stack.
4. Make sure your tests can be run from a single command - create test runner `makefile` or `bash` script to run your tests.

### Problem Statement

Create a menu planning single-page application (SPA) which allows to manage weekly menu and associated recipies.

#### Context

- A [weekly menu](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/plans/) contains a set of [recipies](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/). Each week different set of recipies are selected. See example [menu for this week](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/plans/).
- A [recipe](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/beef-veggie-ragu-spaghetti-5fa9c324cb8f8c0b3a183d01) contains ingredients, step-by-step instructions, nutirtional information, classification, and other metadata. See examples recipes here [1](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/southeast-asian-chicken-coconut-soup-5fa9c26209c8db59115d3f4f), [2](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/saucy-coconut-chicken-noodles-5f9b3c7198ecf4455b27d94d), [3](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/dukkah-roasted-sweet-potato-5f9b43847aacaa50f037d858).
- A customer can review weekly menu as well as recipe by assigning ratings and/or adding comments.

#### Tasks

1. Create a single-page application (SPA) which allows an end user

- create/read/update/delete [recipies](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/). Render recipies as paginated list, display a selected data points.
- create/read/update/delete [weekly menu](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/plans/). Render weekly menu as paginated list (typically 52 weeks in a year).
- assign [recipies](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recipes/) to weekly [weekly menu](https://www.hellofresh.com.au/plans/)

2. You can use mock data or APIs, else you create REST/GraphQL endpoints
3. Write a few unit tests and end-to-end tests for components
4. Write CI/CD pipeline using Github action and deploy app to Github Pages
5. Bonus point if you add Google Authentication and protect routes.
