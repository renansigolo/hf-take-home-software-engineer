## TODO

1. Create a single-page application (SPA) which allows an end user

   1.1 create/read/update/delete recipies. Render recipies as paginated list, display a selected data points.

   1.2 create/read/update/delete weekly menu. Render weekly menu as paginated list (typically 52 weeks in a year).

   1.3 assign recipies to weekly weekly menu

2. You can use mock data or APIs, else you create REST/GraphQL endpoints
3. Write a few unit tests and end-to-end tests for components
4. Write CI/CD pipeline using Github action and deploy app to Github Pages
5. Bonus point if you add Google Authentication and protect routes.
